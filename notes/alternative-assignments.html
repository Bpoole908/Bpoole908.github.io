                </h2>
                <p>This workshop was focused on providing alternative assessments for online courses. Really, most of these ideas presented could be used as substitutes for in-person courses as well. Instead of typical final exams, this seminar looked into how breakdown a final exam into smaller to span over the entire semester or over a period of time near the end of the semester. In addition, it looked at completely replacing exams with writing assignments, projects, and labs. Of course, which type of assessment you choose typically depends on the type of class you are teaching. In essence, the workshop reinforced the difficulty of giving traditional exams in an online setting.</p>
                <p>Why are traditional exams difficult to conduct online? The workshop went into how traditional exams given online typically use Lockdown browser, but recommended against doing actually doing. The reasons given by the workshop were that Lockdown causes stress due to access and privacy. Access meaning that some students may not have the appropriate hardware (e.g. web cam) or operating systems to run the Lockdown or other monitored online exam progrmas.  With regards to privacy these online exam monitoring programs collect data from your computer about your actions. I shouldn’t need to say anymore on the why this might be a privacy concern.</p>
                <p>Overall the workshop did state anything new and innovating, but simply reinforced the idea that maybe traditional exams aren’t the best method of assessment, where this is even more true with online courses.</p>
